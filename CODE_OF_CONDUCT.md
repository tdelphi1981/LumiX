## Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, and to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Enforcement

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

### Enforcement Guidelines

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period. This includes avoiding interactions in project spaces as well as external channels. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban
**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the project community for a specified period. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.

## Academic Dispute Resolution

For disagreements about technical or methodological approaches:

1. Engage in respectful, evidence-based discussion
2. Provide references and justification for your position
3. Be open to alternative viewpoints and approaches
4. Seek input from domain experts if needed
5. Accept maintainer decisions on project direction

Technical disagreements are a natural part of research and development. We encourage healthy debate while maintaining professional courtesy.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted for academic research projects, drawing inspiration from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1, and academic community guidelines.
