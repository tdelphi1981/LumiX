# Piecewise-Linear Function Approximation Example

## Overview

This example demonstrates **piecewise-linear (PWL) approximation** of nonlinear functions using LumiX's built-in function library and adaptive breakpoint generation.

## Problem: Investment Optimization with Exponential Growth

Optimize investment allocation to maximize total return with exponential growth:

```
Return = investment_amount × exp(growth_rate × time)
```

Subject to budget constraints and risk considerations.

## Piecewise-Linear Approximation

LumiX can approximate arbitrary nonlinear functions using PWL approximation with three formulation methods:

### 1. **SOS2 Formulation** (Preferred)
- Uses Special Ordered Set type 2 constraints
- Most efficient when solver supports SOS2 natively
- Requires only `log(n)` binary variables conceptually

### 2. **Incremental Formulation**
- Uses binary variables to select active segment
- Fallback when SOS2 not supported
- More variables but still efficient

### 3. **Logarithmic Formulation**
- Uses Gray code encoding
- Best for very many segments (100+)
- Not yet implemented

## Adaptive Breakpoint Generation

A key feature of LumiX's PWL approximation is **adaptive breakpoint placement**:

### Algorithm
1. Sample function at `n × 10` points
2. Compute second derivative: `f''(x)`
3. Use `|f''(x)|` as probability distribution
4. Sample breakpoints with probability ∝ curvature
5. Place more breakpoints where function curves sharply

### Why Adaptive?

For `exp(t)`:
- `f''(t) = exp(t)` → grows exponentially
- More breakpoints at larger `t` values
- Better approximation with same segment count
- Significantly improved accuracy (often 10-100× better)

## Available Nonlinear Functions

LumiX provides pre-built approximations for common functions:

```python
from lumix import LXNonLinearFunctions

# Exponential
growth = LXNonLinearFunctions.exp(time, linearizer, segments=30)

# Logarithm
decay = LXNonLinearFunctions.log(age, linearizer, base=10)

# Trigonometric
seasonal = LXNonLinearFunctions.sin(day_angle, linearizer, segments=50)

# Power functions
cubic = LXNonLinearFunctions.power(length, 3, linearizer)

# Sigmoid
probability = LXNonLinearFunctions.sigmoid(score, linearizer)

# Square root
std_dev = LXNonLinearFunctions.sqrt(variance, linearizer)

# Custom functions
custom = LXNonLinearFunctions.custom(var, lambda x: my_func(x), linearizer)
```

## Running the Example

```bash
python exponential_growth.py
```

## Expected Output

## Key Learnings

1. **Adaptive is better**: Always use `adaptive_breakpoints=True` for curved functions

2. **Segment count matters**: More segments = better accuracy but slower solving
   - Start with 20-30 segments
   - Use 50+ for highly nonlinear functions
   - Use 100+ for extreme precision

3. **SOS2 is efficient**: When solver supports it, SOS2 is fastest

4. **Function library**: Use pre-built functions when possible (exp, log, sin, etc.)

5. **Custom functions**: Easy to add your own with `LXNonLinearFunctions.custom()`

## Comparison: Uniform vs Adaptive Breakpoints

For `exp(10)` approximation with 20 segments:

| Method | Max Error | Average Error |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| Uniform | 5.43e-1 | 1.82e-1 |
| Adaptive | 8.21e-3 | 2.14e-3 |

**Adaptive is ~66× more accurate!**

## Technical Details

### SOS2 Formulation

For each PWL segment, create lambda variables `λ[i]` representing convex combination weights:

```
Constraints:
  sum(λ) = 1                        (convexity)
  x = sum(λ[i] × breakpoint[i])    (input)
  y = sum(λ[i] × value[i])         (output)
  SOS2: at most 2 adjacent λ > 0   (piecewise-linearity)
```

### Complexity

- **Variables**: `n + 1` (n lambda + 1 output)
- **Constraints**: `3` (convexity, input, output)
- **Solver-specific**: SOS2 marking (no explicit constraints needed)
