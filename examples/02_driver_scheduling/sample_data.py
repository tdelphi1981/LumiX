"""Sample data classes for driver scheduling example.

This module provides data models and sample data for the driver scheduling
optimization example, which demonstrates LumiX's multi-model indexing capabilities.

The driver scheduling problem involves:
    - Multiple drivers with different availability and cost rates
    - Multiple dates with varying coverage requirements and overtime rates
    - Binary decisions: assign driver to date or not
    - Variables indexed by (Driver Ã— Date) cartesian product

This is one of the most powerful features of LumiX, allowing natural expression
of multi-dimensional decision variables without manual index management.

Example:
    Create a multi-indexed variable family::

        duty = LXVariable[Tuple[Driver, Date], int]("duty")
            .binary()
            .indexed_by_product(
                LXIndexDimension(Driver, lambda d: d.id).from_data(DRIVERS),
                LXIndexDimension(Date, lambda dt: dt.date).from_data(DATES)
            )

Notes:
    The cartesian product indexing means that each (driver, date) combination
    gets its own binary variable, making the model naturally express the
    assignment problem structure.

class Driver:
    """Represents a delivery driver with availability and cost information.

    This class models a driver who can be assigned to work on specific dates,
    with constraints on maximum working days and scheduled days off.

    Attributes:
        id: Unique identifier for the driver.
        name: Human-readable driver name.
        daily_rate: Base cost per day in dollars (before overtime multipliers).
        max_days_per_week: Maximum number of days the driver can work per week.
        is_active: Whether the driver is currently available for scheduling.
        days_off: List of unavailable weekday numbers (0=Monday, 1=Tuesday, ..., 6=Sunday).

    Example:
        >>> driver = Driver(
        ...     id=1, name="Alice", daily_rate=150.0,

        Alice costs $150.0/day

    Notes:
        The max_days_per_week constraint is enforced in the optimization model
        by summing assignments across all dates for each driver.
