"""Sample data for high school course timetabling example.

This module provides data models and sample data for the basic timetabling
optimization problem. The goal is to assign lectures to timeslots and classrooms
while respecting various constraints.

The timetabling problem involves:
    - Teachers who teach specific subjects to specific classes
    - Classrooms with limited capacity
    - Timeslots organized by day and period
    - Lectures that must be scheduled without conflicts

This is a classic scheduling problem that demonstrates LumiX's multi-dimensional
indexing capabilities.

Example:
    Create a timetabling model::

        assignment = LXVariable[Tuple[Lecture, TimeSlot, Classroom], int]("assignment")
            .binary()
            .indexed_by_product(...)

Notes:
    Each lecture represents one session of a subject taught by a teacher to a class.
    For example, if "Math for Class 9A" occurs 4 times per week, there would be
    4 separate Lecture objects.
