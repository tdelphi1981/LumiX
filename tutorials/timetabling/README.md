## Key Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Multi-Dimensional Indexing

Variables indexed by three models simultaneously:

```python
assignment = LXVariable[Tuple[Lecture, TimeSlot, Classroom], int]("assignment")
    .binary()
    .indexed_by_product(
        LXIndexDimension(Lecture, lambda lec: lec.id).from_data(lectures),
        LXIndexDimension(TimeSlot, lambda ts: ts.id).from_data(timeslots),
        LXIndexDimension(Classroom, lambda room: room.id).from_data(classrooms),
    )
```

### 2. Database-Driven Models

Load data from database instead of hardcoded lists:

```python
db = TimetableDatabase("school.db")
teachers = db.get_all_teachers()
lectures = db.get_all_lectures()
# Use these in model building
```

### 3. Goal Programming

Mix hard constraints with soft goals:

```python
# Hard constraint (must satisfy)
model.add_constraint(
    LXConstraint("lecture_coverage")
    .expression(expr)
    .eq()
    .rhs(1)
)

# Soft goal (minimize violation)
model.add_constraint(
    LXConstraint("teacher_preference")
    .expression(expr)
    .le()
    .rhs(0)
    .as_goal(priority=1, weight=1.0)  # Mark as goal
)
```

## Real-World Applications

This tutorial's patterns apply to many scheduling problems:

### Education
- **University course scheduling**: Larger scale, more complex constraints
- **Exam timetabling**: Resource constraints, student conflicts
- **Training session planning**: Instructor availability, room requirements

### Healthcare
- **Nurse rostering**: Shift preferences, workload balancing
- **Operating room scheduling**: Surgeon availability, equipment constraints
- **Clinic appointment scheduling**: Doctor preferences, patient priorities

### Business
- **Employee shift scheduling**: Availability, workload fairness
- **Meeting room booking**: Participant conflicts, resource limits
- **Conference scheduling**: Speaker preferences, room capacity

### Transportation
- **Bus driver scheduling**: Route assignments, work hour limits
- **Airline crew rostering**: Regulations, preferences, experience levels

## Extension Ideas

After completing the tutorial, try these extensions:

### Easy Extensions
1. **Add more data**: Increase teachers, classes, and lectures
2. **Change timeslots**: Add more periods or different day structures
3. **Modify priorities**: Use different seniority rules
4. **Add preference types**: Break times, consecutive periods, etc.

### Intermediate Extensions
1. **Student preferences**: Classes prefer morning vs. afternoon
2. **Room preferences**: Certain subjects prefer specific rooms
3. **Consecutive lectures**: Some lectures must be back-to-back
4. **Balanced workload**: Distribute lectures evenly across days

### Advanced Extensions
1. **Multiple buildings**: Add travel time between buildings
2. **Specialized equipment**: Labs, projectors, computers
3. **Web interface**: Flask/Django app for schedule management
4. **Automated updates**: Daily schedule adjustments
5. **Multi-week planning**: Semester or year-long schedules
6. **Enhanced HTML reports**: Add PDF export, email distribution, or embed charts
7. **Real-time editing**: Allow users to manually adjust schedules in the HTML interface

## Tips for Success

### Understanding the Code

1. **Start with Step 1**: Even if you want database integration or goal programming, understand the basics first
2. **Read the READMEs**: Each step has comprehensive documentation
3. **Run the examples**: See the actual output to understand what's happening
4. **Modify gradually**: Change one thing at a time to see the effect

### Debugging

1. **Check hard constraints first**: If infeasible, look at hard constraints
2. **Simplify**: Reduce data size to understand the problem
3. **Print intermediate results**: Add debug prints to understand data flow
4. **Verify database**: Use SQL queries to inspect data

### Performance

1. **Start small**: Test with fewer lectures and timeslots
2. **Scale gradually**: Increase size once working correctly
3. **Use appropriate solver**: CP-SAT often better for scheduling
4. **Profile bottlenecks**: Identify slow constraint generation

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Forgetting prepare_goal_programming()

**Error**: Goal programming doesn't work, all constraints treated as hard

**Solution**:
```python
model.set_goal_mode("weighted")
model.prepare_goal_programming()  # Don't forget this!
solution = optimizer.solve(model)
```

### Pitfall 2: Database Not Populated

**Error**: `Database is empty!` or `No teachers found`

**Solution**: Run `python sample_data.py` first to populate the database

### Pitfall 3: Variable Capture in Lambdas

**Error**: Wrong values in where clauses due to late binding

**Solution**: Capture variables by value:
```python
# Wrong
where=lambda lec, ts: lec.id == lecture.id  # Captures reference

# Correct
where=lambda lec, ts, current=lecture: lec.id == current.id  # Captures value
```

### Pitfall 4: Inconsistent Data

**Error**: Some lectures reference non-existent teachers or classes

**Solution**: Use foreign key constraints in database to enforce consistency
