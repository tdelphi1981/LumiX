## Problem Description

**Scenario**: A furniture factory produces multiple products (chairs, tables, desks) using shared machines and raw materials. The factory must decide how many units of each product to manufacture to maximize profit while respecting resource limits and customer commitments.

**Key Features**:
- Continuous decision variables (production quantities)
- Resource constraints (machine hours, material availability)
- Customer orders with tier-based priorities (Gold/Silver/Bronze)
- Profit maximization with goal programming

**Data Scale by Step**:

| Element | Step 1-3 | Step 4 |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Products | 3 | 9 (3x) |
| Machines | 2 | 6 (3x) |
| Materials | 3 | 9 (3x) |
| Periods | 1 | 4 weeks |
| Customers | 5 | 8 |
| Orders | 9 | 15 across periods |
| Variables | ~10 | ~1,600 (160x) |

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Continuous Variables

Variables representing quantities (not binary assignments):

```python
production = LXVariable[Product, float]("production").continuous()

for product in products:
    production.add_index(
        product,
        lower_bound=product.min_demand,
        upper_bound=product.max_demand
    )
```

**Contrast with binary variables (timetabling)**:
- Binary: assignment = 0 or 1 (yes/no)
- Continuous: production = any value â‰¥ 0 (how much)

### 2. Resource Consumption Constraints

Aggregate resource usage across products:

```python
# Machine capacity constraint
machine_hours_expr = LXLinearExpression()
for product in products:
    machine_hours_expr.add_term(
        production,
        index=product,
        coeff=hours_per_unit[product]
    )

model.add_constraint(
    LXConstraint("machine_capacity")
    .expression(machine_hours_expr)
    .le()
    .rhs(available_hours)
)
```

### 3. Profit Maximization

Optimize an objective (not just find feasibility):

```python
profit_expr = LXLinearExpression()
for product in products:
    profit_expr.add_term(
        production,
        index=product,
        coeff=product.profit_per_unit
    )

model.set_objective(profit_expr, sense="max")
```

### 4. Database-Driven Models

Load data from database instead of hardcoded lists:

```python
db = ProductionDatabase("production.db")
products = db.get_all_products()
machines = db.get_all_machines()
# Use these in model building
```

### 5. Goal Programming

Mix hard constraints with soft goals:

```python
# Hard constraint (must satisfy)
model.add_constraint(
    LXConstraint("machine_capacity")
    .expression(expr)
    .le()
    .rhs(available_hours)
)

# Soft goal (minimize violation)
model.add_constraint(
    LXConstraint("customer_order")
    .expression(expr)
    .ge()
    .rhs(target_quantity)
    .as_goal(priority=1, weight=1.0)  # Mark as goal
)
```

## Extension Ideas

After completing the tutorial, try these extensions:

### Easy Extensions

2. **Add more constraints**: Minimum production runs, labor hours
3. **Modify priorities**: Use different customer tier rules
4. **Add costs**: Include material costs in objective

### Intermediate Extensions
1. **Inventory management**: Track stock levels over time
2. **Multi-period planning**: Plan for multiple weeks
3. **Setup costs**: Add fixed costs for production runs
4. **Transportation**: Add shipping constraints and costs

### Advanced Extensions
1. **Stochastic demand**: Handle uncertain customer demand
2. **Multi-site production**: Multiple factories
3. **Supply chain**: Integrate suppliers and distribution
4. **Real-time optimization**: Daily re-optimization with new data

## Tips for Success

### Understanding the Code

1. **Start with Step 1**: Understand continuous variables first
2. **Read the READMEs**: Each step has comprehensive documentation
3. **Run the examples**: See actual output
4. **Modify gradually**: Change one thing at a time

### Debugging

1. **Check constraints**: Verify resource limits make sense
2. **Simplify**: Reduce data size to understand the problem
3. **Print intermediate results**: Add debug prints
4. **Verify database**: Use SQL queries to inspect data

### Performance

1. **Start small**: Test with fewer products and orders
2. **Scale gradually**: Increase size once working correctly
3. **Use appropriate solver**: OR-Tools good for linear problems
4. **Profile bottlenecks**: Identify slow operations

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Forgetting prepare_goal_programming()

**Error**: Goal programming doesn't work, all constraints treated as hard

**Solution**:
```python
model.set_goal_mode("weighted")
model.prepare_goal_programming()  # Don't forget this!
solution = optimizer.solve(model)
```

### Pitfall 2: Database Not Populated

**Error**: `Database is empty!` or `No products found`

**Solution**: Run `python sample_data.py` first to populate the database

### Pitfall 3: Infeasible Problem

**Error**: Solver returns infeasible

**Causes**:
- Total demand exceeds capacity
- Not enough materials for minimum production
- Conflicting constraints

**Solution**:
- Verify resource availability vs. demand
- Check constraint formulations
- Reduce demand or increase capacity

### Pitfall 4: Wrong Variable Type

**Error**: Using binary variables instead of continuous

**Solution**:
```python
# Wrong (binary)
production = LXVariable[Product, int]("production").binary()

# Correct (continuous)
production = LXVariable[Product, float]("production").continuous()
```

## Comparison with Timetabling Tutorial

Both tutorials demonstrate LumiX capabilities but focus on different problem types:

| Aspect | Production Planning | Timetabling |
|--------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Variable Type** | Continuous (quantities) | Binary (assignments) |
| **Problem Type** | Optimization (maximize profit) | Feasibility (find valid schedule) |
| **Dimensions** | 1D (Product) | 3D (Lecture Ã— Time Ã— Room) |
| **Core Challenge** | Resource allocation | Conflict avoidance |
| **Goal Programming** | Customer orders | Teacher preferences |

**Both tutorials teach**:
- Database integration
- Goal programming
- Multi-objective optimization
- Solution persistence
